# My Text Editor

## Description 

My Text Editor is a text editor that runs in the browser.The app will be a single-page application that works with or without internet. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## Usage

My Text Editor is very simple and upfront to use. when the application is opened, a client server folder structure will be shown. `npm run start` will need to envoked from the root of the directory to start up the backend and serve the client of the application.

After the application have be initialized, JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack and HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file will generate. If next-gen JavaScript is used, the appliction will still function with no errors.

When Text Editor is opened, the IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage which will allow the user content to be saved if the DOM window is clicked off and can be retrived even after closing the text editor. 

User can click on the Install button and the application will be downladed as an icon on the desktop.
